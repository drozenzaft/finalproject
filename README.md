APCS1 2016-17 Final Project: IAD's Trip Planner<br><br>
Collaborators:<br>
Ida Wang<br>
Daniel Rozenzaft<br><br>
Ever wanted a downgraded version of Google Maps? Well look no further, because now you can use IAD's Trip Planner to calculate your route! (Given that you are only traveling in Manhattan, you can only travel by subway, and knowing how long it will take is not all that important...)<br><br>
List of Working Features:
<ul>
<li>route calculation between two stations on the same line</li>
<li>GUI to input stations (can reverse their order without retyping)</li>
</ul><br>
List of Unresolved Bugs:
<ul>
<li>cannot support transfers</li>
<li>exact String of the station name must be given</li>
<li>[insert other bugs I cannot remember here...]</li>
</ul><br>
Directions:<br>
Compile both CSVRoute.java and Layout.java. Running Layout will produce a GUI, where the user can input the start and end stations. In case it isn't clear, the "SWITCH" button reverses the start and end stations, and "CALCULATE" produces directions for the route.
