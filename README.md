APCS1 2016-17 Final Project: IAD's Trip Planner<br>
Ever wanted a downgraded version of Google Maps? Well look no further, because now you can use IAD's Trip Planner to calculate your route (given that you are only traveling in Manhattan, you can only travel by subway, and that knowing how long it will take is not all that important...)! <br><br>
List of Working Features:<br>
Currently, the Trip Planner can calculate the route between two stops on the same line, which can be done through a GUI.<br><br>
List of Unresolved Bugs:<br>
- cannot support transfers<br>
- exact String of the station name must be given<br>
- [insert other bugs I cannot remember here...]<br><br>
Directions:<br>
Compile both CSVRoute.java and Layout.java. Running Layout will produce a GUI, where the user can input the start and end stations. In case it isn't clear, the "SWITCH" button reverses the start and end stations, and "CALCULATE" produces directions for the route.<br><br>
